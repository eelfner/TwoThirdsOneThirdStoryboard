# TwoThirdsOneThirdStoryboard

Very simple demonstration of setting up StoryBoard view with a proportional constraint.

This allows views to be positioned with a size that takes up, for example, 1/3 of the parents space
and is done so dynamically so that on device rotation, the propotional space stays the same based 
on the new parent size.
